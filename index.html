        <h3 id="AboutMe1">My Story</h3>
        <p>Hello everyone, is Francesca here! I am an Italian girl and I have been living in London for almost 6 years.</p>
        <p>I grew up in Italy, in a small town called Pianella, situated in the centre of Italy on the east coast.</p>
        <p>I left my childhood house at the age of 18 and I started my new, life lasting adventure. Moved first to a small town to attend university, I have always been interested in exploring and learning new <i>things</i>, reason why while studying, I took part in a project called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Programme" target="_blank"><b>Erasmus Study</b></a> first and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/opportunities/traineeships-students_en" target="_blank"><b>Erasmus Placement Programme</b></a> later on.</p>
        <p>Both projects gave me the opportunity to live, study and work in Spain for almost two years. It was absolutely an amazing experience, a personal growth that gave me the chance to meet people from all over Europe, learn Spanish and discover a new culture! When I left Spain I had so much knowledge, so many new friends and unforgottable memories.</p>
        <p>After one year I packed my stuff and took off to London. I immediatly fell in love with this magic city, I made it my home and I couldn't picture myself living somewhere else.</p>
        <p>Its vibes, multicuturality, vitality, diversity make <i><b>London</b></i> one of the best city for me.</p><p>I am really pleased and fascinated by how much you can do and, actually learn in London. It always gives you a change to reinvent yourself and face new challenges.</p>
        <p>Today, I am here applying for a coding course, <em>wow!!!</em></p>
        <p>Honestly, like most of best things I have done in my life, I never thought I would have been so interested and keen to learn how to code.</p>
        <p>After many years in London I was in dead a point. I had different jobs but I could not find anything that was giving me sparkle and motivation. I (with my interest for tecnology) suddenly approached the coding community, attending different meet-ups and learning online first and, finding out about Founder and Coders later.</p>
        <p>As soon as I started learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, I realised how much I like- not without a bit of struggle- coding. It brought back my passion for numbers, formulas, algorithms, logical operations and made me realise that coding makes me excited not only for the knwoledge but because it reflects my personality too.</p>
        <p>I believe my analytical and pragmatic mindset, curiosity, problem-solving skills, creativity and stubburness reflect the coding world. On the other side my empathy, team player attitude and love for learning would make myself if not a great, a good and certainly happy Web Developer. I know the way is long, the path is new and most probably a bit difficult at times but there is always a first step.</p>
        </p>Not least, I would love to mention I found the coding community being the greatest and most supportive community ever, but I will tell you about that later on, keep on reading...<p/>

            <ul>
                <li><i><b>Travelling&exploring</i></b>: I do not like going on holiday but I <i>love</i> travelling, discovering and new adventures. I always try to get involved with the local community of the country I visit and learn a bit about them and their culture.</li>
                <li><i><b>Learning languages</i></b>: Learn a new lenguage gives me the opportunity to get to know better people, their behaviour and culture. I speak Italian, Spanish, Franch and English.</li>
                <li><i><b>Cooking&eating</i></b>: I love preparing home made dishes, baking cakes and sharing them with my flat mates and friends. I always have fun making up new recepies with the available ingredients. It is a way to discover new tastes and dishes.</li>
                <li><i><b>Team sports</i></b>: Running or exercising make me feel good but playing a team game make me feel great! Sharing the same goal and create cooperation and support in order to archive it, makes me way happier than a personal achievement.</li>
                <li><i><b>Working,teaching&volunteering with children</i></b>: I always been surrounded by children and I learnt how to deal with them. I made of my passion a job, I worked with them and taught them basic Italian. I love working with them because they always teach you something new.

                <h3 id="AboutMe3">Founders and Coders</h3>
                <p><i>Why I chose Founders and Coders?</i></p>

                <p>When I first approached the coding, everything was totally new to me (a part the fact I have always been so fascinated from tecnology, computers, programs and all this sort of things). I have been reading a lot online and went to different meet ups to have a better understanding.</p>

                <p>On my first Founders and Coders meet up I was impressed by your core values. The strong value of community and the willingness of helping others. I liked the fact Founders and Coders offers tuition-free training and makes it accessible for people who have no economical resources.</p>
                <p>I was pleased to find out about the programme "Tech for better": it made me realise there is a real and tangible connection between coding and the chance to help people in real life and understand how helpful is the tecnology for the community.</p>

                <p>On Mondays meet ups, I have seen all the guys working so hard and for long hours, and always whit a big smile on their faces. I found out the most supportive, helpful and collaborative community I ever seen, where people do not make you feel judged but encourage you to archive your goals and learn more. A place where there is space for everyone ideas. </p>

                <p>I have been working quite hard in the last few months, lot of times I struggled and sometimes I still do, but I have found an absolute great support in Founders and Coders. I am quite happy of what I accomplished done so far and I am motivated to go ahead.</p>
                
                <p>I hope I will take part on the next cohort but whatever is going to happen, I would you like to say thank you to the Founders and Coders team that made my journey easier and efficent.</p>

                <p><i>Thank you all!!!</i></p>
