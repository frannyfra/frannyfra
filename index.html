            <h3 id="AboutMe1">My Story</h3>
            <p>Hello everyone, Francesca here! I am an Italian girl and I have been living in London for almost 6 years.</p>
            
            <p>I left my childhood house at the age of 18 and I started my new, life lasting adventure. Moved first to a small town to attend university, I have always been interested in exploring and learning new <i>things</i>, reason why I took part to a project called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Programme" target="_blank"><b>Erasmus Study</b></a> that gave me the opportunity to live and study in A Coruña- Spain for a year. It was absolutely an amazing experience, a personal growth that gave me the chance to meet people from all over Europe, learn Spanish and discover a new culture!</p>
            <p>After one year, when back to my country, I decided I did not want to stop travelling and more than anything else, I did not want to stop learning. I packed one more time and took off for Valencia-Spain in order to take part to an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/opportunities/traineeships-students_en" target="_blank"><b>Erasmus Placement Programm</b></a>. 
            <p>Despite the choise of a known country, things were sliglthy different from my first "adventure". I wasn't anymore a student but a worker and the idea was making myself truly excited and scared at the same time but once again, it was absolutely a blast! I left Valencia after 6 months with so much knowledge, new friends and unforgottable memories.</p>
            <p>After one year I packed my stuff and took off to London. It has been almost 6 years since I arrived in London. I immediatly fell in love with this magic city, I made it my home and now I couldn't picture myself living somewhere else.</p>
            <p>Its vibes, multicuturality, vitality, diversity make <i><b>London</b></i> one of the best city for me.</p><p>I am really pleased and fascinated by all the things you can do and actually learn in London. It always gives you a change to reinvent yourself and face new challenges.</p>
            <p>Today, I am here applying for a coding course, <em>wow!!!</em></p>
            <p>Honestly, like most of best things I have done in my life I never thought I would have been so interested and keen to learn how to code.</p>
            <p>After many years in London I was in dead point. I had different jobs but I could not find any job that was giving me sparkle and motivation. I (with my interest I have for tecnology) suddenly approchead the coding comunity, attending different meet-ups and learning online first and, finding out about Founder and Coders later.</p>

            <p>As soon as I started learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, I realised how much I like- not without a bit of struggle at the beginning- coding. It took back my passion for numbers, formulas, algorithms, logical operations and made me realise that coding makes me excited not only for the knwoledge but because it reflect my personality too.</p>

            <p>I believe my analytical mindset, curiosity, pragmatism, problem-solving skills, creativity, empathy, team player and love for learning would make myself if not a great, a good and certainly happy Web Developer. I know the way is long, the path is new and most probably a bit difficult at times but there is always a first step.</p>
            
            </p>Not least, I would love to mention I found the coding community being the greatest and most supportive community ever where the word help really got its full meaning. But I will tell you about tht later on, keep on reading...<p/>
